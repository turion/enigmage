1. Make sure you have satisfied all dependencies. So far, these are:
	Necessary:
	a. python (version 2.6 so far, 3 soon)
	b. pygame
	Optional:
	c. Python Imaging Library
	d. sqlite3
2. Copy (or symlink) the package files to a directory /usr/share/local/lib/python2.6/enigmage or elsewhere so that it is importable by enigmage-viewer.py
	Windows users freak out, start to cry or do whatever they want at this point.
3. Write a enigmage-viewer.py or take the example
4. Start (with command line arguments, if you choose to support it) python enigmage-viewer.py
