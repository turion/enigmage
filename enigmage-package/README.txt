enigmage is a intuitive library designed to build a personalized, customizable image viewer (or maybe media player in the future).
It consists of two parts:
1. The package enigmage, where the actual work is done, useful classes are defined and the bindings to the backends (SDL via pygame, PIL, some SQL soon, maybe OpenGL and much more one day) are declared.
2. enigmage-viewer.py, a simple example choice of a layout and settings.
